# Video SDK for iOS code examples POC

Use the contents in this repo to compare the following ways of presenting runnable code examples in an open source 
repository. In all examples, the code corresponds to a page in the Agora developer documentation. 

- **Current Doc examples**

  Each folder contains the project that is created when you follow the steps in the current documentation.

  Advantages are that the code and doc already exist. Disadvantage is that you have to follow the docs to make the code run.
  - [SDK quickstart](./current-examples/get-started-sdk/readme.md)
  - [Call quality](./current-examples/ensure-channel-quality/readme.md)


- **Simplified examples that extend from a base class**

   Each folder contains the runnable code explained in the documentation. 

    Advantages are that we supply runnable code where the UI is abstracted so we concentrate more clearly on Agora
     SDK. This means the docs become much shorter and simpler. Possible disadvantage is that we have to write the
     code for the project. TBH, we already have the code, we are just putting it in a better format for learning.
